This game is not finished!
--------------------------
- Don't expect it to work as well as a finished game will.
- Please report any bugs. When doing that, debug.txt is useful.

Paths (Outdated)
------
$bin   - Compiled binaries
$share - Distributed read-only data
$user  - User-created modifiable data

Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
$bin   = bin
$share = .
$user  = .

Linux installed:
$bin   = /usr/bin
$share = /usr/share/minetest
$user  = ~/.minetest

OS X:
$bin   = ?
$share = ?
$user  = ~/Library/Application Support/minetest

World directory
----------------
- Worlds can be found as separate folders in:
    $user/worlds/

Configuration file:
-------------------
- Default location:
    $user/minetest.conf
- It is created by the game when it is run the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
	--config <path-to-file>

Command-line options:
---------------------
- Use --help

Compiling on GNU/Linux:
-----------------------

Install dependencies. Here's an example for Debian/Ubuntu:
$ apt-get install build-essential libirrlicht-dev cmake libbz2-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg8-dev libxxf86vm-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libsqlite3-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfreetype6-dev cmake make gcc bzip libbz2-dev

Download source, extract (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times):
$ wget https://github.com/Reign-of-Darkness/Reign-of-Darkness/tarball/master -O master.tar.gz
$ tar xf master.tar.gz
$ cd Reign-of-Darkness (or whatever)

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:
$ cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=1
$ make -j2

or make a final version:
$ cmake .
$ make

Run it:
$ cd bin
$ ./minetest

- Use cmake . -LH to see all CMake options and their current state
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package), you will want to use -DRUN_IN_PLACE=0
- You can build a bare server or a bare client by specifying -DBUILD_CLIENT=0 or -DBUILD_SERVER=0
- You can select between Release and Debug build by -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger
- If you build a bare server, you don't need to have Irrlicht installed. In that case use -DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=/the/irrlicht/source

Compiling on Windows:<br/>
---------------------
- This section is outdated and I can't get it to work. If you do, please tell me :)<br/>

- You need:<br/>
	* CMake:<br/>
		http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html<br/>
	* MinGW or Visual Studio<br/>
		http://www.mingw.org/<br/>
		http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default<br/>
	* Irrlicht SDK 1.7:<br/>
		http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/downloads.html<br/>
	* Zlib headers (zlib125.zip)<br/>
		http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html<br/>
	* Zlib library (zlibwapi.lib and zlibwapi.dll from zlib125dll.zip):<br/>
		http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html<br/>
	* Optional: gettext library and tools:<br/>
		http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/gettext.php<br/>
		- This is used for other UI languages. Feel free to leave it out.<br/>
	* Libvorbis 1.3.3<br/>
                DLL=http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?libvorbis<br/>
                INCLUDE=http://xiph.org/downloads/<br/>
	*Libvorbisfile<br/>
                DLL=http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?libvorbisfile<br/>
                INCLUDE=libvorbis/include<br/>
	*Libogg<br/>
                INCLUDE=http://xiph.org/downloads/<br/>
                DLL= http://www.dlldump.com/download-dll-files_new.php/dllfiles/L/libogg.dll<br/>
	* And, of course, Reign of Darkness:<br/>
		https://github.com/Reign of Darkness-Team/Reign of Darkness<br/>
- Steps:<br/>
	- Select a directory called DIR hereafter in which you will operate.
	- Make sure you have CMake and a compiler installed.
	- Download all the other stuff to DIR and extract them into there.
	  ("extract here", not "extract to packagename/")
	  NOTE: zlib125dll.zip needs to be extracted into zlib125dll
	- All those packages contain a nice base directory in them, which
	  should end up being the direct subdirectories of DIR.
	- You will end up with a directory structure like this (+=dir, -=file):
	-----------------
	+ DIR
		- zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
		- zlib125dll.zip
		- irrlicht-1.7.1.zip
		- 110214175330.zip (or whatever, this is the minetest source)
		+ zlib-1.2.5
			- zlib.h
			+ win32
			...
		+ zlib125dll
			- readme.txt
			+ dll32
			...
		+ irrlicht-1.7.1
			+ lib
			+ include
			...
		+ gettext (optional)
			+bin
			+include
			+lib
		+ Reign of Darkness
			+ src
			+ doc
			- CMakeLists.txt
			...
		+ libvorbis-1.3.3.zip
                       + lib
                       + include
                         ...
		 + libogg-1.3.0.zip
                       + lib
                       + include
                         ...
	-----------------
	- Start up the CMake GUI
	- Select "Browse Source..." and select DIR/Reign of Darkness
	- Now, if using MSVC:
		- Select "Browse Build..." and select DIR/Reign of Darkness-build
	- Else if using MinGW:
		- Select "Browse Build..." and select DIR/Reign of Darkness
	- Select "Configure"
	- Select your compiler
	- It will warn about missing stuff, ignore that at this point. (later don't)
	- Make sure the configuration is as follows
	  (note that the versions may differ for you):
	-----------------
	  BUILD_CLIENT                         [X]<br/>
	  BUILD_SERVER                       [  ]<br/>
	  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE             Release<br/>
	  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX     DIR/minetest-install<br/>
	  IRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR       DIR/irrlicht-1.7.1<br/>
	  RUN_IN_PLACE                        [X]<br/>
	  WARN_ALL                                 [  ]<br/>
	  ZLIB_DLL                                    DIR/zlib125dll/dll32/zlibwapi.dll<br/>
	  ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR                 DIR/zlib-1.2.5<br/>
	  ZLIB_LIBRARIES                       DIR/zlib125dll/dll32/zlibwapi.lib<br/>
 	  LIBVORBIS_INCLUDE_DIR    DIR/libvorbis-1.3.3/include<br/>
	  LIBVORBIS_LIBRARIES           DIR/libvorbis.dll<br/>
          LIBVORBISFILE_INCLUDE_DIR    DIR/libvorbis-1.3.3/include<br/>
          LIBVORBISFILE_LIBRARIES           DIR/libvorbisfile.dll<br/>
          LIBOGG_INCLUDE_DIR          DIR/libogg-1.3.0/include<br/>
          LIBOGG_LIBRARIES                DIR/libogg.dll<br/>
	  GETTEXT_BIN_DIR                  DIR/gettext/bin<br/>
	  GETTEXT_INCLUDE_DIR       DIR/gettext/include<br/>
	  GETTEXT_LIBRARIES             DIR/gettext/lib/intl.lib<br/>
	  GETTEXT_MSGFMT                 DIR/gettext/bin/msgfmt<br/>
          OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenAL\include<br/>
          OPENAL_LIBRARIES=C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenAL\lib\OpenAL32.lib<br/>
	-----------------
	- Hit "Configure"
	- Hit "Configure" once again 8)
	- If something is still coloured red, you have a problem.
	- Hit "Generate"
	If using MSVC:
		- Open the generated minetest.sln
		- The project defaults to the "Debug" configuration. Make very sure to
		  select "Release", unless you want to debug some stuff (it's slower
		  and might not even work at all)
		- Build the ALL_BUILD project
		- Build the INSTALL project
		- You should now have a working game with the executable in
			DIR/minetest-install/bin/minetest.exe
		- Additionally you may create a zip package by building the PACKAGE
		  project.
	If using MinGW:
		- Using the command line, browse to the build directory and run 'make'
		  (or mingw32-make or whatever it happens to be)
		- You may need to copy some of the downloaded DLLs into bin/, see what
		  running the produced executable tells you it doesn't have.
		- You should now have a working game with the executable in
			DIR/minetest/bin/minetest.exe
